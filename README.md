# Grady McGradeface

Grady McGradeface checks a CSV file for student numbers and calculate how many failed and who. It supports calculation in points and percentages.

It treats cells that have a string (for example "absent") as errors that you can set as a failing condition as well.

A "test.csv" file has been supplied to demontstrate its use.
